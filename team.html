			<p>ENGINEERS</p>
			<p>The basic concept behind this lift is using gravitational potential energy in the rain to make the lift go up and down, making the lift virtually carbon neutral. 
The water which falls is stored in a series of reservoirs in the neighbouring trees,  this is used to fill up the counterweight which will cause the lift to go up.
when the full counterweight reaches the floor it is emptied and the water pumped up back to the reservoir, the lift will go down by its own weight since its heavier than the empty counterweight.
Electricity to power the pumps and electronic control system is obtained by using regenerative breaking to slow down the descending lift/counterweight, turbines in water flow and solar panels.</p>

			<p>IDENTITY TEAM</p>
			<p>Our logo represents the natural harmony of the rainfall, plant growth and our developing habitat. The two raindrops moving respectively up and down bring together the basic function 
				of the lift system and its main power source, the water.  Our name plays on words - "Vitalitree" represents the natural liveliness of the community and the fact that we're relying on 
				these trees for life. </p>

			<p>STRATEGISTS </p>
			<p>We will do this in three stages. Firstly, we would be best off arriving in the first wave of settlers on the planet im order to have first mover advantage. By providing transport 
				for the building and developing within the first stage of the community to aid with the infrastructural work that is mandatory in making a safe and comfortable community. In 
				the second stage we will approach private residents who may wish to have their own elevators, companies which could us it to transport goods to where they are operating and community 
				transport. The third stage will be to join with businesses while pushing new developments and innovations to help the new world prosper. This could include but not be limited to mining in 
				the tundra biome in the future.</p>
